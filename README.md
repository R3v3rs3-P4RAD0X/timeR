# timeR

timeR is a lightweight Progressive Web App for tracking work entries. Record the date, start and finish times, note if lunch was taken and add a description of the tasks completed. Entries are stored in your browser and can be queried over custom ranges or quick presets like last week or last month. Each entry automatically deducts 30 minutes when lunch is marked.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Add entries via the form and search for totals using a custom range or preset buttons. Install to your device home screen for an app-like experience.
